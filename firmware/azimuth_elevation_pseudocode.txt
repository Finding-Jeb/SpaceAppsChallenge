func(sat_lat, sat_long, sat_alt, lat, long):

	//work out position vectors for each
	   	    
	vec_sat, vec_user = Alt x [ cos(long)cos(lat), sin(lat), -sin(Long)cos(lat) ]

	M =

	use arctan(x, y) to get compass: careful choice of function needed, so it has a return range of 360 degrees
	convert appropriately to compass direction
	(this will depend on exact math library)

	elevation = arctan(z / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) )
